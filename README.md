## What is Aviator?

Aviator is a **crash game**, which means it operates on a simple, yet
thrilling principle: the multiplier continuously increases, and your
goal is to \"cash out\" before the multiplier crashes. In the game, you
watch as a plane takes off, and the potential payout increases with the
altitude. The longer you wait, the more you can win, but there's always
the risk that the plane will disappear at any moment. If you don't cash
out before the plane disappears, you lose your bet.

This game has captured the attention of players worldwide, especially in
India, where it's being offered at multiple online casinos. Let's dive
